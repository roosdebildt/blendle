## UI Engineer Assignment

Dear blendle front-end team,

Thanks for the challenging assignment. I had a lot of fun working on it! The result can be found on: http://roosdebildt.github.io/blendle/app/.
</br>Side-note: don't mind the image quality. In a "real-life" situation I would've asked the designer for higher resolution files. 
</br>I didn't make it to fancy dropdowns, animations or other extra's yet but I hope you like it as far as I got.

Keep on rocking!

## Set-up:
- Clone the repo
- run `npm install`
- run `gulp` and it should fire up a browser window with a live-server automatically
