## UI Engineer Assignment

Thanks for taking time to work on this assignment! We have a small list with some requirements on the assignment.
- Recreate the design as pixel perfect as possible (we deliver a sketch file, make sure all fonts are installed on your system)
- Animations should be super slick. These can be done with CSS as well as with JS.
- Responsive
  - we will check on a recent Android and iPhone, and the most recent Chrome, Firefox, IE11.
- Progressive enhancement, it is still functional (with or without animations) in older browsers (like IE9).
- Accessible would be nice.
- Deliver the source, and a working index.html

## User story
- Opening the page should show the article card
- Clicking the card should open the full article
- Clicking the images in the article should show a larger version
- Clicking the large image version should close it, and return back to the article
- Feel free to blow us away with some extraâ€™s you like. Amaze us with your approach. Most importantly: you should be confident of your choices.

Good luck!
